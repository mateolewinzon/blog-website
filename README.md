## Project remarks
- `/components/*` : Contains all of the components used in the app.
- `/lib/*`: External libraries utilized mostly in the server side of the App. The files containing '-client' in their name are OK to use client-side.

Use env.example as a guide to which environment variables are needed in the project.
